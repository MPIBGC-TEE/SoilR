                                   
				   Changes to version 1.1-29
==============================================================================================
- Two new functions were added to compute transit time and age densities for linear models.
  These functions are systemAge and transitTime. 
- Package expm is now required. It is used to calculate the matrix exponential in the
  computation of system age and transit time distributions. 
- The Century model was added.
- Nonlinear microbial models were implemented. These include: AWBmodel, ThreepairMMmodel,
  TwopMMmodel, and bacwaveModel.

                                   Changes to version 1.1.
==============================================================================================
- The name structure of the SoilR internal classes has been changed. 
  There are two new main virtual super classes, DecompOp and InFlux. 
  DecompOp includes the subclasses ConstLinDecompOp and BoundLinDecompOp. 
  ConstLinDecompOp implements time-invariant decomposition operators, while
  BoundLinDecompOp implements time-dependent decomposition operators with time bounds. 
  At the moment, InFlux only includes the subclass BoundInFlux, which is a time-bounded
  input flux. 

- The TimeMap class is now deprecated. It is replaced by the classes DecompOp and InFlux.
   
- The radiocarbon component of SoilR is now fully implemented.
  The function GeneralModel_14 is the constructor of linear models 
  that track the radiocarbon fraction in different pools. 

- Two new classes were created for radiocarbon-related objects, ConstFc and BoundFc.
  ConstFc takes a numeric argument and a unit argument specifying the units of radiocarbon 
  reporting. BoundFc also takes these arguments plus two others specifying the time range
  for which the values are valid. See help files of these classes for additional details.

- New datasets were added with the concentration of radiocarbon in the atmosphere. These are
  IntCal13 and Hua2013. 

- SoilR now requires package parallel in addition to deSolve.
